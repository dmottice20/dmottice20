- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmottice20
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, AI, and blockchain. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on publishing my research in reinforcement learning and air combat. I'm also improving my full stack skills to be more flexible in how I can leverage my data science skills and help decision-makers make higher-quality decisions at a higher velocity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving my coding ability in GoLang, approaches to a better RL approach for my research, and new technologies to keep an eye on.
- 📫 How to reach me: Just comment on one of my repos.
