- 👋 Hi, I’m @dmottice20
- 👀 I’m interested in all things AI and ML. My background is in the more theoretical space and Operations Research. And  
- 🌱 I am actively learning how to build and deploy AI/ML at scale by focusing on CUDA, Docker, K8s, and other database technologies to build seamless customer experiences w/ AI. 
- 💞️ My passion is generalizing RL! I truly believe RL is one of the key unlocks for the next wave of AI. Specifically, how do we adapt the RL environment autonomously for the task and action at hand?
- 📫 How to reach me: Just comment on one of my repos.
